        We’ve been helping startups launch and grow their businesses. We help
        you to fill the gap between development,
        <br />
        design and product management.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed
          collaborators. All aspects of our software development process are
          integrated, iterative and agile.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our approach unifies design, development and product management to
          create exceptional products. We start each project by understanding
          your business goals, the user’s needs and the product requirements.
          Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions.

        <p>
          Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend
          the necessary time needed to understand your product vision. The
          outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement
          of work. Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete
          offering or just the pieces you need.

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <img src="../img/design-lab/Shape-1.svg" alt="" />
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          Our design practice offers a full range of services including branding
          strategy, interaction and visual design and user experience testing.
          Throughout your project, our designers create and implement visual
          designs and workflows, solicit user feedback, and work with you to
          make sure what gets built is what is needed.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/design-lab/Shape-2.svg" alt="" />
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>
          All engineers are fluent in the latest enterprise, mobile and web
          development technologies. They collaborate with your team to write,
          test, and improve code on a daily basis, using proven practices such
          as test-driven development and pair programing.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/design-lab/Shape-3.svg" alt="" />
        <h3>Product Management</h3>
        <p>
          Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly
          coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go live.
          This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements
          evolve.
